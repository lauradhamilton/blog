The official Google plugin for publishers, written by Google. Supported products include AdSense and Webmaster Tools. This is a beta release.

== Description ==

The Google Publisher Plugin enables you to easily use Google's products - including AdSense and Webmaster Tools - with your WordPress site.

Adding AdSense ads usually requires you to generate snippets in AdSense and paste these into your site, or to manually edit PHP files. This plugin lets you place AdSense ads using a simple point-and-click UI.

This beta version of the Google Publisher Plugin allows you to:

* Easily add AdSense ads to your site to make money from advertising.
* Verify your site with Webmaster Tools with just one click.
